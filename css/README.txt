CSS Instructions

Open the `main.css` file in your preferred editor to complete the following instructions.
Some CSS selectors are already provided in the `main.css` to be updated, however, you will also need to create your own for some of the instructions.

To see your changes, the `index.html` file should be open in a browser. Refresh the page to see your changes in action.
